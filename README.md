clearquest
==========

wrapper around the clearquest V7 COM object.

The skeleton has been generated with the help of Hdirect.
Then some changes were needed in order to communicate with
the COM object.

TODO:
=====
* cabal file and upload to hackage
* get some understanding of the variant things because I always get an
  `variant: found IDISPATCH` error when I try to use a function who returns
  a variant array ....
